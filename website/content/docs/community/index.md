Contributions are accepted through our [GitHub][github] and [Google
Source][googlesource] repositories. Individual projects have their own
[contribution process][contributing].

## Community

The authoritative document for community resources and organization is the
[community repository][community], which contains the project's [governance
model][governance] and [code of conduct][codeofconduct]. Individual repositories
have their own guidelines and processes for contributing. See the [canonical
list of repositories][repositories] for more information.

The project maintains two mailing lists:

* [gvisor-users][gvisor-users] for accouncements and general discussion.
* [gvisor-dev][gvisor-dev] for development and contribution.

We also have a [chat room hosted on Gitter][gitter-chat].

The community calendar shows upcoming public meetings and opportunities to
collaborate.
